# color-block-puzzle

Create a puzzle app where you have a grid of colorful blocks (about 4-8 different colors depending on difficulty level) where you drag and drop the blocks to swap colors. When three blocks with the same color line up (horizontally or vertically) they disappear and the spots they were in become empty. It is possible to drag blocks to empty spots (then the original place of the block becomes empty). Let me know if you have any questions about details.
